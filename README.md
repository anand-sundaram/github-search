# Github-search

GitHub Search is an application which allows you to search for repos on GitHub by keyword. It is a simple single-page application which uses [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) and [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/). This project is my attempt at learning EmberJS, possibly at the cost of over-engineering.
